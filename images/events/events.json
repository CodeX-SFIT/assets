      "description": "CodeXpress 3.0 is the third edition of the coding competition organized by the Code-X team for their fellow coders. This competition was conducted on 7th March 2020. The competition was divided into two sections which were the Alpha level competition which provided the maximum number of participants and the Beta level competition. There were a total of 87 participants for this competition among which 65 were for the Alpha competition, and 22 were for the Beta competition. As it was a competitive competition we used the Techgig platform to organize it.<br />The Alpha level competition was typically held for coders who had previous experience in taking part in such competitive competitions. At the Alpha level, the participants could participate as a solo competitor or in a group of two. A total of eight questions were divided into three sections according to the level of difficulty starting from easy to hard.<br />The Beta level competition was held for coders who had no former experience taking part in such competitive competitions and for beginners who genuinely wanted to improve their competitive coding and test their coding skills. In the Beta level, the participants could participate as a solo competitor or in a group of two. A total of twelve questions were divided into three sections according to the level of difficulty starting from easy to hard. Mentors were provided to the participants if they needed help during the competition. Also during the competition all the participants were provided with tea and coffee according to their convenience.",

    "description":"The Blockchain workshop was organized by the Code-X committee on 28th and 29th September 2019.As it was a hands-on workshop, the sessions were divided into 2 days slots and covered the basics of Block Chain.\r\n\r\nThe session was conducted by Mr. Vikash Kumar and Mr. Jetso Analin on both days. A total of 43 participants were involved in both the days of the workshop.\r\n\r\nDay 1\r\nSession 1:\r\n\u201CIntroduction to Blockchain\u201D was covered which included the major reasons why we should work on the blockchain as it is immutable, very secure, it is transparent, decentralized any many more. The instructors mainly focused on these terminologies making sure all participants were able to keep up. The instructors gave access to all the participants to their apps \u201DBlocklogy\u201D and \u201DBlockLogy Lite\u201D to acquire more knowledge about blockchain.\r\n\r\nSession 2:\r\nThe participants were introduced to the application of blockchain as they created their very own digital wallets and then added some virtual ethers in it and shared with each other. Before concluding the session participants were shown the live applications of blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nDay 2\r\nConducted by Mr. Jetso Analin, the participants were introduced to the term \u201Csmart-contract\u201D. They were also introduced to a new programming language Solidity which is required to work on blockchain technology. The participants using solidity created their own virtual digital currency. In the final session, the participants created their own banks to handle basic transactions. Before concluding the session, the members of the BlockLogy team informed the participants about the internships they provide and how one can work with them.",

      "description":"The main idea for the Workshop was inspired by the students\u2019 need to make a Java Project. CodeX Team decided to help and teach, the students of SE CMPN A and B, the basic concepts required to make a Java software which stores the data in a database. It was conducted under the guidance of Prof. Tejal Carwalho (Faculty for OOPM - SE CMPN A and B) and Prof. Rupesh Mishra (CodeX Coordinator).\r\n\r\nThe Speakers for the day were:\r\n\r\nManas Acharya\r\nSanket Dalvi\r\nSahil Nirkhe\r\nAssisted by CodeX geeks:\r\n\r\nRitika Bhole\r\nDaniel Lobo\r\nDwayne Fernandes\r\nLeander Fernandes\r\nKevin Fernandes\r\nSession 1:\r\nThe Workshop started at 10:00am. The first session, on JavaFX using SceneBuilder was taken by Manas Acharya. The students followed the steps and progressed towards making their own layout. The Technical Team was handling the doubts of the students while also explaining the necessary content. At 12:00pm, the students and the volunteers were given a lunch break of 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nSession 2:\r\nThe workshop resumed at 12:45pm and the session was taken over by Sanket Dalvi. The topic was MySQL CRUD using phpMyAdmin. After a short brief on the theory, the students were guided on the practical way to implement it.\r\n\r\nSession 3:\r\nThe final session of the workshop on Java Database Connectivity was taken by Sahil Nirkhe. With the explanation of how to connect the previous two sessions and make the project complete, the step by step code and its explanation was given. After the successful compilation and presentation of the code, the Technical team volunteers took rounds to solve the errors in the students\u2019 code. By the end of the workshop, students had a functional project ready with them."
